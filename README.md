# Mental Disorder Classification using Neural Networks

This repository contains a project aimed at accurately identifying mental disorders using a neural network model. The project leverages a dataset from Kaggle that includes various mental disorder classifications based on participant symptoms.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop, train, and evaluate a neural network model to classify depressive mental disorders: Mania Bipolar Disorder, Depressive Bipolar Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and 'Normal' Individuals. The project demonstrates the integrated use of multiple tools and techniques, including data preprocessing, neural network design, model training on Google Colab, documentation in Jupyter notebooks, and comprehensive reporting using Overleaf.

## Key Features
- **Neural Network Model**: Implementation of a neural network to classify mental disorders.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Documentation of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Google Colab Integration**: Training and evaluation of the model using Colab's GPU resources.
- **Overleaf Report**: A detailed report on the methodology, results, and findings.
- **GitHub Repository**: Organized project files with a clear structure and comprehensive README.
